# Productivity Equation

## What is productivity?
It is defined as how much work can be done in the smallest amount of time. So, productivity can be formulated as:

$$productivity = \frac{useful\space{}output}{time} \times f$$

where $f$ is the fun factor. More useful output in less time increases productivity. This equation can be described as a pilot-plane-engineer tuples. The pilot defines the direction of the plane. The plane is just follows the instructions of the pilot. The engineer maintains both the pilot and the plane. We can see that the pilot is the useful part of the equation, the plane is the output, and the engineer is the time. If you want to increase your productivity, you must understand which area needs improvement. Know yourself first! So, answer the following question:

- Which do i struggle with most of all? The pilot, the plane, or the engineer? in what specific ways?
    - I think the most important part for me is the pilot. I have to define my purpose, vision, and goals clearly.
