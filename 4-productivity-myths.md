# The Three Myths of Productivity
In this section, we're going to learn about three important myths about productivity. 

## First Myth: I don't have time!
As `William Penn` stated many years ago, 
==Time is what we want most but what we use worst!==

> Tips to remove the myth
> - Just eliminate the phrase *I don't have enough time* from your vocabulary.
> - Nothing is limited by time but by how we choose to use our time!
> - Read the book `Make Time by Jake & John`
> - Time is just like muscle, the more you squeeze it

## Practice 2
What am I avoiding with the phrase `"I don't have time"`?
- I think when I say this phrase, it implies that I do not have control over my time and as a result I let others to control me with whatever they can such as movies, or thinking a lot about past events, or paying attention to news. I have time for what I think is important. I have time to grow my health, wealth, relationship and anything I want. 

- Optional action point
    - Track your time for one week and then reflect on what you're spending your time on.
